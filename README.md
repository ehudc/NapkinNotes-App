## Napkin Notes Application for iPhone or iPod Touch

This application was developed for a new course in the fall/winter of 2011 at Rutgers University titled "Mobile App Development from Concept to Market".

It was built by me, with my classmate and project partner Dan Kohanim helping debug and organize the project plan, timeline, reports and presentations.

To view a user manual and discussion of the code, please see the .pdf titled "Napkin Notes User Manual and Code Discussion".

Lastly, this being an iPhone application you will need Xcode to run it. More information on Xcode can be found at developer.apple.com/xcode/
